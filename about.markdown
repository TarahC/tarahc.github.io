Hello, my name is Tarah Cavallaro (or Munk) I am a mechanical engineer actively transferring into cybersecurity.

My background in engineering has led me to become an analytical, results-driven, and innovative professional, and to possess a
strong technical background including technical writing; system planning, designing, and testing; continuous
improvement; data analysis; and project coordination. Armed with exceptional skills in project
documentation, project leadership, as well as communication at all technical levels I feel ready to take the steps necessary to become a cyber security professional.

I'm excited to share this journey with all of you. Hopefully, some of my struggles and triumphs will help the next person along their path.
