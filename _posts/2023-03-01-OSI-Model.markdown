If you, like me, have trouble remembering and keeping straight all seven levels of the OSI model, I would recommend trying the TryHackMe OSI model room. I think it is one of the most clear and succinct explanations of the model I've seen going through my studies. Also, there is a fun little mini game at the end to help you remember!

Can you beat my high score of 24 seconds?

P.S. I know seven is a lot, but we've got this!
